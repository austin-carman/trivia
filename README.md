# Trivia Game

The motivation behind this project is 3 fold:
1. `Practice`, practice, practice.
2. Seek `advice` to improve my coding skills and meeting best coding practices. I want to learn from you!
4. Learn about possible `job opportunities`. I am actively seeking job opportunities and if you are aware of any I would love to hear from you!

## Overview

This trivia game, styled using MUI, allows users to select a category and difficulty level. Selected answers will be blue if correct and red if incorrect. The "Score" above each question indicates the number of correctly answered questions in the current question set (there are 20 questions in each category). After answering the final question the current score and the user's previous high score are displayed. Users can also view their high scores for each category and may reset any category's high score.

The questions used in this project are retreived from [Open Trivia Database API](https://opentdb.com/).

## Running the project

From the repo:
  1. Clone this project locally
  2. `cd` into project directory
  2. Run `npm install` in your command line
  3. Run `npm start` in your command line to view in browser

## Dependency list

- [React](https://react.dev/)
- [MUI](https://mui.com/)
- [Axios](https://axios-http.com/docs/intro)
- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/)
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io/)

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
